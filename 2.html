        In 2015, Dr. Gabe Mirkin, M.D., the doctor who initially coined the term R.I.C.E in his 1978 book "The sports medicine book", has eliminated his recommendation for ice except within the first six hours since injury to reduce pain, as it as since been shown to reduce healing. The inflammation is reduced due to a decrease in leukocytes and granulocytes and the restriction of macrophage infiltration. These physiological changes can slow down the healing process. Typically, when the body detects an injury, it sends a message to the inflammatory cells (macrophages) to produce growth factor (IGF-1). This kills the damaged tissue, resulting in healing. However, ice causes vasoconstriction when applied. This prevents the transport of inflammatory cells and chemicals. If IGF-1 cannot get to the site of injury, the healing process can be delayed, or even inhibited
        Even more, studies have found a significant decrease in one's capability to reproduce knee joint flexion in the sagittal plane and causes a lack of varus control leading to a valgus shift in the frontal plane during eccentric contraction after the use of cryotherapy.
        There is no definitive evidence that ice is effective or ineffective. But evidence does show that ice can be used as an adjunct to therapeutic rehabilitation in that ice helps reduce localized pain. A combination of cryotherapy followed by exercise saw the best result in strength gain. Exceeding the recommended time for ice application may be detrimental, as it has been shown to delay healing.
        Ice reduces the inflammatory response and pain associated with heat generated by increased blood flow and/or blood loss. A good method is apply ice for 20 minutes of each hour. Other recommendations are an alternation of ice and no-ice for 15–20 minutes each, for a period of 48 to 72 hours, and then apply heat if swelling is gone. It is recommended that the ice or heat pack be placed within a towel or other insulating material before wrapping around the area.
